# Website Check
### I was born lazy and have since then continued to be lazy I do not like constantly refreshing a page to see if there is a new update.

* This will work for any site for which the code does not change periodically.
* This will not work for any site that requires a login (i.e. you can't use it to check for new fb messages)
